# 🔍 Aether

A **modular and scalable search engine** built to process, index, and rank web data using modern Big Data technologies.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

This project is structured into **four main modules**:

### 1. 🕷️ Crawling
Collects raw web data from multiple sources concurrently, storing it for later processing.

### 2. 🧠 Indexing
Tags and structures the collected content, converting it to **Avro** format for efficient storage and compatibility with distributed systems.

### 3. ⚙️ Ranking
Computes document relevance through algorithms based on **content and link analysis**, preparing optimized data for search queries.

### 4. 🔎 Searching
Processes user queries and retrieves **ranked results** based on computed relevance scores.
